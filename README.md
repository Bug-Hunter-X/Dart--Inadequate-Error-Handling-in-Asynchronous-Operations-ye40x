# Dart Asynchronous Operation Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling within asynchronous functions using `async`/`await`.  The `fetchData` function attempts to retrieve data from an API.  While it includes a `try-catch` block, the error handling within the `catch` block is minimal. This can lead to unexpected program behavior if network issues occur, or the API returns an error status.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the lack of robust error handling in the `catch` block of the `fetchData` function.  Simply printing the error isn't sufficient;  more sophisticated handling is necessary for production-ready code.

## Solution

The solution provides more effective error handling.  It demonstrates how to use more specific exception types, provide informative error messages to the user, and potentially retry the operation or fallback to alternative data sources.
